"It was a long journey," sighs May. "And it was a much bigger job than anyone realised; we didn't talk much about it," he adds, still plainly uncomfortable with the recollection.

"We were able to work with Freddie on it, but hardly at all, and the object was to make an album that sounded like four guys in a studio. We knew that if we achieved that, then no one would ask any questions. And that's almost what happened."

"We started of with just scraps of tape. It was a huge job, two years of my life finding a way of developing the songs, but at the same time using the limited input we had from Freddie. Sometimes there was a complete first take vocal, while other times there were no more than three or four lines."

"It was a labour of love for me, working through he night perhaps on just one line. But if you can listen to, for example, I Was Born To Love You and say that it was a good performance, I'm glad it sound so, but obviously it couldn't have been."

The final bridge between Queen and 'Another World' was built by the release of the original track No One But You for the recent compilation 'Queen Rocks'. Although it was written by Brian for possible inclusion onto his own album, things didn't work out that way.

"When I wrote No One but You, it fitted into my original concept of what my album was supposed to be - I was going to make it about the heroes of my childhood; you know, do a Buddy Holly track, something by Hendrix, all kinds of things. Anyway, it was written as a sort of tribute to Freddie and before long, I became aware I was trying to make it sound very Queen-like. There are some musical and verbal quotes in there and I thought, if it's going to sound like Queen, maybe it ought to be Queen. I sent the track to Roger and he loved it and said we had to do it."

"Although I lost that track from my album, it worked out alright in the end; it was the final thing that made me realise I was on the wrong track for my album anyway."

Brian: That was very tough. Doing the Made In Heaven album when Freddie was not around and hearing his voice every day. It was kind of torture some of the time. You would get through it after a while, but then it would come back. You'd hear him laughing on a little out-take or something and you'd think "Ah, shit, why isn't he here." It was very tough. Very sad. But the album has his presence all through it. We worked very hard to achieve that and I think we managed to achieve a group album, even though he wasn't there. I would never do it again. It took probably two and a half years of my life to assemble some of that stuff. It wasn't easy.
Roger: Yeah. You Don't Fool Me turned out quite well. That really was sort of , put together after. It, was quite a skeleton that we had on that one and that was really sort of made after the fact, if you know what I mean. Actually it became incredibly successful in , or popular, in, over Europe. I think, more so than this country. It's actually... I quite enjoyed that one.
