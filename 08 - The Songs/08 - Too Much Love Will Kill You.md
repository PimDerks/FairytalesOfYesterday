"If there was ever a song for which I would have wanted to 'win a prize for', this would have been the one," said Brian May as he collected the award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for his joint composition Too Much Love Will Kill You at the 42nd Ivor Novello Awards in London on May 29th.

"Perhaps there are two kinds of song," said Brian, accepting his statuette, presented to him by Sting, along with co-writer Frank Musker. "Some songs happen, simply because somebody sits down and decides to write a song. But there is another kind, like this one, which HAS to be written, because the writer has no choice. This happened at a time when I was going through a very difficult period; it was written as a kind of therapy. In this case I was very much the patient and Frank (Musker) was very much the therapist who helped me through it. The song was an important part of my life, and really still is, so this Award means a lot to me." Frank thanked Freddie and Brian for their singing of the composition, and Roger and John for their part in the performance.
