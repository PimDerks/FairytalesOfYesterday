VH1, March 1997
Brian: I always remember the moment Joe Elliott grabbed my sleeve as we were going off at the end and said, "Brian, you have to stop for a minute and just look at this and think what it is because you're never gonna see anything like this again". And he was right, so it was great to have those people playing with us, very thrilling for us and I think we did the job for Freddie.

Brian interviewed by Richard Skinner
Virgin Radio, Tuesday 15th June 1993

Richard: There are rumours about material in the can, taped with Freddie performing on it that hasn't seen the light of day. Will it one day? Or is it better put on the shelf?

Brian: It's a difficult question and it's something we don't find it easy to agree about at the moment, I have to say. I won't push the point. Yes there is a bit of material but probably not enough for a whole album but then you have the difficult question of whether you go in there and kind of pad it out to make a Queen album, or just put it out as it. I would favour at the moment not pretending that we're Queen. In my mind, it just seems like there cannot be a Queen without Freddie and we should probably rather not pretend that there could be.

Richard: So don't add new material, recorded recently?

Brian: Difficult area really. I mean it's possible. We did do tracks without Freddie in the past, but I don't feel we should be clinging that much to the past. We should be moving out and moving on.

Richard: I must add my plea to at least have the tracks that were recorded released. Maybe as an EP.

Brian: Well I'd love to have them out there. They have to be definitely out there. They're the last things that Freddie did, and they're very precious. It needs careful handling.

"Nobody's had any bright ideas yet," Queen's drummer Roger Taylor, 43, says in a rare interview.
"We're all still friends, we're obviously in business together, we still sell records. Whether we'll actually play together again apart from in the studio, I really couldn't say."
