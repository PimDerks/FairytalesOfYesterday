RM How did Freddie face up to his obvious and imminent death in the last sort of months, was he brave about it?

BM Unbelievably, I never knew anybody like Freddie. I never saw him complain, he was always very positive, quite matter of fact, you know. He said "Look I probably haven't got much longer,and we should do this and this and this, and I want to sing as much as I can. Write me words, write me lyrics, write me something to sing".

RM Cause his voice stayed strong, didn't it?

BM Fantastic. But, I mean, he was having a hard time at the end, and he maybe had half an hour a week where he could sing, and he would go for it, have a Vodka, whoop it down, go for it, you know, and some of those top notes he hit on the last few tracks are unbelievable.

RM Did he have any regrets at the end, or did he feel... I mean, in a sense a lot of rock stars die suddenly, like Hutchence, you know, like Hendrix, they go with an overdose or an accident or something. He obviously had lots of warning. Was he prepared for death?

BM More than anyone I've ever known, I think he was, yeah. I think he felt very proud of what he'd done, you know musically, and of what we'd done, and he loved being in the studio that was a great escape for him I know. We had some great fun in those last months, strangely enough, you know. I don't know if he had regrets. I know he loved kids and think he probably would have liked to have kids. That's probably one of the few things which he never talked about to most people. But professionally I think he gave it everything he'd got, as fast and as hard as he could, and he went for it and I think he's proud of himself.
