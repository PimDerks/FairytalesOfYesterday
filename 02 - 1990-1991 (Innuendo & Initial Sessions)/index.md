RM How did Freddie face up to his obvious and imminent death in the last sort of months, was he brave about it?

BM Unbelievably, I never knew anybody like Freddie. I never saw him complain, he was always very positive, quite matter of fact, you know. He said "Look I probably haven't got much longer,and we should do this and this and this, and I want to sing as much as I can. Write me words, write me lyrics, write me something to sing".

RM Cause his voice stayed strong, didn't it?

BM Fantastic. But, I mean, he was having a hard time at the end, and he maybe had half an hour a week where he could sing, and he would go for it, have a Vodka, whoop it down, go for it, you know, and some of those top notes he hit on the last few tracks are unbelievable.

RM Did he have any regrets at the end, or did he feel... I mean, in a sense a lot of rock stars die suddenly, like Hutchence, you know, like Hendrix, they go with an overdose or an accident or something. He obviously had lots of warning. Was he prepared for death?

BM More than anyone I've ever known, I think he was, yeah. I think he felt very proud of what he'd done, you know musically, and of what we'd done, and he loved being in the studio that was a great escape for him I know. We had some great fun in those last months, strangely enough, you know. I don't know if he had regrets. I know he loved kids and think he probably would have liked to have kids. That's probably one of the few things which he never talked about to most people. But professionally I think he gave it everything he'd got, as fast and as hard as he could, and he went for it and I think he's proud of himself.

Champions of the World
By the time we were recording these other tracks after Innuendo, we had had the discussions and we knew that we were totally on borrowed time because Freddie had been told that he would not make it to that point. I think our plan was to go in there whenever Freddie felt well enough, just to make as much use of him as much as possible, we basically lived in the studio for a while and when he would call and say, 'I can come in for a few hours', our plan was to just make as much use of him as we could, you know he told us, 'Get me to sing anything, write me anything and I will sing it and I will leave you as much as I possibly can.'

“We all knew there wasn’t much time left,” says Brian May, the Queen guitarist who was at that session in May 1991. "Freddie wanted his life to be as normal as possible. He obviously was in a lot of pain and discomfort. For him the studio was an oasis, a place where life was just the same as it always had been. He loved making music, he lived for it.”

“Particularly towards the end of his life he was pursued by the press and curious people. He just wanted peace and quiet, to be able to get on with what he did. It was very convenient in Montreux because people got used to the sight of us and nobody made a fuss.”

“I was surprised at how moving it was to come back in here and listen to him again as he was,” says Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions. “This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn’t sad, it was very happy. He was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [of his illness] '---- that. I’m not going to think about it, I’m going to do this.’ We all were.”

May says: “He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.’ He had no fear, really.”

His vocal is surprisingly strong at times. “I don’t know where he found the energy,” says May. “Probably from vodka. He would get in the mood, do a little warm up then say, 'Give me my shot.’ He’d swig it down ice cold. Stolichnaya, usually. Then he would say, 'Roll the tape’. He still had astonishing power in his lungs at that point, I really don’t know where it came from. The song starts low and gentle, but Mercury chose to push himself and go higher. We looked at each other and knew there was a mountain to climb. That’s when the vodka really went down. He said, 'I will hit these notes.’ And he did. It was a wonderful performance.”

Mercury was exhausted by the effort, adds May. “We got as far as the penultimate verse and he said, 'I’m not feeling that great, I think I should call it a day now. I’ll finish it when I come back, next time.’ But, of course, he didn’t ever come back to the studio after that.”

The other members of the band worked on while Mercury rested in his apartment. “We always ate together. That was lovely. Then the day came when he said, 'Look, I’m going back to London for a while.’ It was always 'a while’. Nothing was ever 'the end’.”

He went back to London for the last time in early November 1991 and died at his home in Kensington on the 24th. May was in London when he heard the news, along with the rest of Queen.

“We were all wondering if it was an illusion, and he was going to be cured. You can’t really take these things in properly. Then we got the phone call. It was surreal. Even though we had been preparing for such a long time, it still didn’t feel possible,” says May “We all got together and talked and had a drink and then saw it announced on the TV. Strangely enough, that was when it seemed real for the first time. You thought, 'Oh my God, he really has gone and everybody knows now. It can’t be taken back’.”

Later, the recordings Mercury had left were pieced together for the posthumous album Made In Heaven, one of Queen’s biggest sellers.

“A lot of the time it feels as if Freddie is still with us, even though physically he is not,” says May, who is working with Roger Taylor on a new film about the band.

Queen - A Kind Of Magic
BBC Radio 1 Interview - December 1995

n the late eighties, the realisation that Freddie was unwell dawned on the band. The signs were there for them to see. It's human nature to deny such things, but eventually it was Freddie who raised the subject.
Brian: We talked about it, and he said ..well, first of all he said, "you probably realise what my problem is, you know, my illness", and by that time we kind of did, it was just kind of, it was unspoken, you know, and he said "Well, that's it, and I don't want it to make any difference." He said, erm,"I don't want anything to be any different whatsoever, I don't want it to be known, I don't wanna talk about it, I just want to get on and work, until I can't work anymore" and that was it. I don't think any of us will ever forget that day. We all went off and sort of got quietly sick somewhere I think.
Roger: Freddie knew his time was limited and he really wanted to work and to keep going. He felt that that was the best way to keep his spirits up and he wanted to leave as much as possible, and we certainly agreed, you know, great, anyway, so we backed him up right to the hilt, and so really I think Innuendo was really made very much on borrowed time, and actually I still believe it to be a tremendously underrated album. It's much better than a lot of the other albums we made I think. The Miracle, he wasn't that well, but he wasn't that ill, and that was more of sort of a bit of an effort, a bit of a long album to make, but Innuendo was, he really wasn't very well, and I think there are some extraordinary performances on that one. I find it a very strong album all the way through, it's quite emotional.
[Somebody To Love]
With the acceptance of his illness came a flurry of recording activity. He lost himself in work. Freddie's best friend, Mary Austin:
Mary: I think it was the one thing that gave him much happiness. It made him feel alive inside through the pain he was experiencing. I think that fed the light inside, instead of things becoming dull and life becoming painful, looking at each morning, there was something else. There was something else he was working for. Life wasn't just taking him to the grave. There was something else he could make happen through that, and he did.
Queen, as in the early years, became a busy, tightly knit unit again in the adversity of Freddie's illness.
Brian: Because the group situation has always been so intense, like a safe place in our lives, I mean, we have conflicts within the group, which we can talk about and that's a different matter, it's insulated from the real, kind of grown up worries of life. You're really in a separate world, and I think Freddie did feel safe in that environment. Things were just as they always had been and probably we all tried too hard, I don't know [laughs] I don't know if I should even talk about it now, but we did, we tried to just make things very normal, and it seemed to work.
[I Want To Break Free]
So there was The Miracle, Innuendo, and, in the can, the makings of the last album, a bookend album, all recorded to some extent or other in their Montreux studio. Queen's manager, Jim Beach:
Jim Beach: I think it was a place which was a place to get away, where you were still really in your own domain. Certainly in his latter years, he came here partly as a refuge, there's no question, because the paparazzi were camping round his house, and he couldn't really go out to a restaurant in London or anything without somebody trying to take a photograph of him. His private life had completely disappeared, and this gave him a haven, without any doubt.
Despite rapid loss of strength and energy, Freddie Mercury drove himself, as always, to deliver the best performance.
Brian: Fred, as normal, got to some point and said "No, no ,no ,no, no, this isn't good enough, I have to go higher here, I have to put more into this, have to get more power in," so he downs a couple of Vodkas [laughs] stands up and goes for it, and you can hear the middle eight of Mother Love just soars to incredible heights, and this is a man who can't really stand any more without incredible pain and is very weak, you know, has no flesh on his bones, you know, and you can hear the power, the will that he's still got.
[Mother Love]
Mother Love was the last song that Freddie recorded. It's ironic that his swan song should have been recorded in Montreux, the Swiss town that he'd once found boring, and in the recording studio that he'd once said should be under the lake rather than beside it.
Brian: A lot of it was really, strangely enough, quite joyous, you know. It sounds odd to say that, and people are gonna hate me for saying it , but I know Freddie had some very good times in those last periods, and he was able to put it to one side and get one. And I think there was maybe a part of him that thought the miracle would come. I think we all did. I suppose you do, don't you. You never give up hope and Freddie was certainly like that. I never saw him kind of lay down, put his head in his hands, and let it all get on top of him, never ever. He would always just get on with things. And we had some very funny times, we were very focused and very together as a group. And I think we all regarded... we all realised how precious those moments possibly were gonna be.
Despite the media attention - his house was under siege for the last 18 months - he refused to give any press information. Only on the day before his death in November 1991, did he allow any announcement to be made about his condition
Roger: I think the last thing that he wanted was to draw attention to any kind of weakness or frailty , which was all too obvious anyway, you know, "look at me" , he didn't want any kind of pity or anything like that, and he was incredibly brave about the whole thing. Having said that, he didn't want to be usurped by sort of going, popping off and he said "look, I might pop off at any moment", that's what he used to say, erm, by sort of popping off, and then having not announced it, so I think that it was absolutely right to do it at the time it was done.
[I Was Born To Love You]
Mary: It took him a long long time to accept to himself that he had AIDS. How could he tell the world when he couldn't accept it himself? Freddie was all about living. He lived, he wrote, he produced, he was all about living, he wasn't about death.
