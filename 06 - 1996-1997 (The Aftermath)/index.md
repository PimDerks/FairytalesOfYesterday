VH1 Interview, March 1997:
Roger: There's a new ballet written by the father of French modern ballet, Maurice Bejart and it's written around our music with a few bits of Mozart thrown in which is quite a flattering mixture isn't it? And it's a wonderful work, it's a great piece and Elton thought that it would be lovely if we just came on at the end with the ballet and performed 'The Show Must Go On' as a surprise which we did and it was great, it was a lovely experience.
Brian: I was surprised that I enjoyed it, because in the interim period, I've very much been trying to get Queen out of my system, and I know that probably doesn't sound very nice but in a way it's unhealthy to be just clinging to the past.
Roger: It's a difficult thing, but having said that, it's been 5 years since Freddie's death now and I think we don't feel quite so precious about it as we did and we accept it as something that happened and it's in the past now and, so I think maybe the future is open to us doing something again.
Brian: I know people would love to see us together and stuff, but it would have to be in the right way, not in some way which would spoil what went before.
Roger: Elton put it very well, he said, "You lot are like a fantastic racing car, sitting in the garage with no bloody driver", which was a great analogy I thought, and very flattering; but you know, we'll see.

Brian : No. When I made him listen to - and finally record! - "No-one but you", which he was going to sing with me on my album anyway, before we decided otherwise...

RM But you got back together in the studio to record "No One But You", which is the one you wrote.

BM We did, that's right.

RM Which you wrote about two years ago.

BM I did. It was going to be for the solo album, but the chaps liked it a lot and thought it was kind of an important thing

RM Is it about Freddie?

BM Yes I really wrote it about Freddie, but as you deal with a song, of course, it expands in it's meaning, I suppose, and we've lost a lot of people too young, recently, you know with Princess Diana and very sad to hear about Michael Hutchence the other day. So it's something which is in your mind a lot.

Away from Queen
---------------

Brian May on BBC Radio 2
Interview with Richard Allinson
Monday 6 July 1998 11.03 pm.

I don't really think about Queen when I get up in the morning these days. You know, it's been a long time and I'm very happy to be away from it. I gave it my all when it was there you know, and it was my life, you know -um very proud of what we did - but these days my heads in a another place and I don't really think about um, does this fit in with Queen because its, its not my life any more, you know. I just get up and I think, "Is this any good, does it mean something, um and will able to enjoy taking this out on the road?" That's, that's basically what, what goes through my head, I think. Um - so the same, I have the same commitment to quality as I had with, with Queen, you know, and I, I wouldn't let anything go out unless I thought it was absolutely there. Which is probably why it takes me so dam long to make things. (laughs) But I'm not gauging it by, you know, does this fit in with Queen fans, 'cos Queen fans are VERY understanding I find on the whole, you know. They don't expect any of us to, to fulfil any kind of, er, expectations or, or fall into any old patterns, and that's a great relief. I wouldn't want to do it anyway, you know. It's very important for me to get out on my own and, and follow my own path and this album is something which I never could've made with Queen - it's very different and a lot more personal and, um, in, in, in a way a lot more exacting to my standards, because it's not a democracy any more. You know, I'm not arguing with people as to which note goes in where. It's (laughs)..

Brian:No, there are no plans for Queen to do so and it's probably mostly my fault. I don't really find myself comfortable in that. I don't think we should be stretching it out I don't think we should try to replace Freddie. Queen without Freddie is not Queen. I'm quite comfortable with that. I had a lot of time to get used to it. It's been very painful. There are still times. there is always moments when you think: 'Ouch! I wish we coud do that.'

Queen Rocks

RM Well the album's called "Queen Rocks", but what were you saying about you've got different art-work?

BM Well we're celebrating. We said when it got to a million we'd change the album cover.

RM Yeah.

BM I don't know if you know the mythology of this, the old Queen crest is here and it's been exploded here, for obvious reasons probably, and this ugly old bird is flying off, and here the bird has flown. So this will be the new album cover from I think the week after next or whatever.

RM Excellent.

BM So I guess the first one will become a collectors item.

RM All right. Well, look thank you very much for being here.
